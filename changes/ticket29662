  o Minor features (debugging):
    - Introduce tor_assertf() and tor_assertf_nonfatal() to enable logging of
      additional information during assert failure. Now we can use format
      strings to include pieces of information that are relevant for trouble
      shooting. Resolves ticket 29662.
