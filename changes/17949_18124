  o Minor features (platform compatibility):
    - Change network interface lookup code to make it possible
      to specifically ask either for loopback or for general
      purpose interfaces. Now get_interface_address6{_list}()
      refrain from returning loopback interfaces and 
      get_loopback_address6{_list}() exclusively search for
      them. Resolves ticket 17949.
    - Refrain from getting network interface names on Windows
      as Tor does not use them for anything. Resolves ticket
      18124.
